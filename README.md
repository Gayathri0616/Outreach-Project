# Algorithmic Bias Demonstration

    This project is a simple interactive website designed to demonstrate how algorithms can perpetuate bias in various areas, such as social media, hiring, and loan applications. The goal is to increase public understanding of AI ethics issues.

    ## Project Overview

    The website provides interactive examples that illustrate how algorithms can lead to biased outcomes. Users can explore different scenarios and see how algorithmic decisions can be influenced by input data and the underlying algorithms themselves.

    ## Features

    -   **Interactive Examples:** Demonstrations of algorithmic bias in social media, hiring, and loan applications.
    -   **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface for easy exploration.
    -   **Clear Explanations:** Descriptions of the input data, algorithms, potential biases, and interactions.
